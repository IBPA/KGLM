## Directories

If your directory contains sub-directories, It's a good idea to describe those sub-directories like this. With large respositories, it's almost impossible to put README in each directory like this. But for small research repositories like what usually have, this really helps the first-time readers.

* <code>[sub_dir1](./sub_dir1)</code>: This sub directory does this.
* <code>[sub_dir2](./sub_dir2)</code>: This sub directory does that.
