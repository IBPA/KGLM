# Title of the Project Goes Here

Put a short description of what this project is about. You can optionally put figure like I did below. Usually, I find Figure 1 of the paper to be a good fit. I created ```images``` branch to store the all the images so that you can avoid them being in the master working tree. For more info and other ways to embed a image files to the README file, please refer to this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10189356/how-to-add-screenshot-to-readmes-in-github-repository). For more information on how to use markdown, please use this [link](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). You can use this repository as a template when creating your repository. Please use this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for more info on that. Finally, you can refer to the [LOVE repository](https://github.com/IBPA/LOVE) for sample.

## 1. Directories

In this section, you should describe briefly what each directory contains. I don't want to enforce same directory format for everyone since every project is different. Key here is to name the directories specific yet succint as possible. Please look at famous repositories like [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) or [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) for some ideas.

* <code>[data](./data)</code>: Contains all data files.

## 2. Getting Started

Not all project is same. You can modify the headings below a little to be more suitable for your project. If you wish to release the repository as a package, please refer to this great [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NZSE_JKInoYgkV7KUI4T5yO8QmFycwStMW_9PrR-IEE/edit) Fang created.
